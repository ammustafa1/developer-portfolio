            My name is Ashraf Mustafa, and I am a full-stack developer from
            Raleigh, North Carolina. I am a graduate of East Carolina University, transitioning into the developer space after spending the early years of my career in customer service and Emergency Medicine. <br></br>
            I embarked on my developer journey through UNC's full-stack coding Bootcamp. I aim to be a versatile
            developer that is constantly trying to perfect my skills and explore new technologies to become as
            proficient as possible in both front-end and back-end development.
