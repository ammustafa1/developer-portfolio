        Hi, my name is Ashraf Mustafa and I am a full-stack developer from Raleigh, North Carolina. I have a Bachelor of Science in Public Health from East Carolina University and a background in customer service and emergency medicine. I recently transitioned into the developer space through UNC's full-stack coding bootcamp. <br></br>
        I am an enthusiastic coder with a passion for learning and a desire to be a valuable addition to any company. During my bootcamp, I completed several projects that allowed me to apply my skills in a practical setting. I am confident in my ability to work well in a team and bring my strong problem-solving skills and quick decision-making to any project.
        <br></br>
        Outside of work, I enjoy team-based sports, combat sports, video games, hiking, overlanding, snowboarding, coffee brewing, and cooking.
